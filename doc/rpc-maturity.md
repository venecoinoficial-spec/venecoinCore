RPC method maturity
-------------------

This document records the maturity of each method made available by the venecoin
Core RPC. Maturity is expressed over 3 stages:

1. UNSTABLE - These methods are often new, and can change within minor version
   updates.
2. STABLE - These methods can be used safely and will not see breaking changes
   on minor version updates.
3. DEPRECATED - These methods are no longer recommended to be used and may be
   removed in future versions.
